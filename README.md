    GET name – Print out the value of the variable name, or NULL if that variable is not set.

    UNSET name – Unset the variable name, making it just like that variable was never set.

    NUMEQUALTO value – Print out the number of variables that are currently set to value. If no variables equal that value, print 0.

    END – Exit the program. Your program will always receive this as its last command.
